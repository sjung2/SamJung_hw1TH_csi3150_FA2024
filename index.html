        <h3>A little bit about me</h3>
        <p>I’m currently a student studying how to increase shareholder value (finance) while also minoring in the art of typing out colorful numbers and words in lines, hoping they'll do something (computer science). I’ve spent most of my summers amazed at how tissue boxes work and also interning at startups or buy-side funds (mostly venture capital)
            When I'm not doing student stuff, I enjoy brainstorming ideas that could land me in Y Combinator, reading strictly non-fiction, trying out new restaurants, and staring at cars I can't afford. If you care to learn more about my interests check out my <a href="./HTML/Resume.html">Resume</a> or learn some <a href="/HTML/FunFacts.html">Fun facts</a> about me </p>
